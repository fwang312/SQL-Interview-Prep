解法一：
```html
SELECT customer_id, customer_name
FROM Customers
WHERE customer_id IN
(SELECT customer_id 
 FROM Orders
 WHERE product_name = 'A'
) 
AND customer_id IN
(SELECT customer_id 
 FROM Orders
 WHERE product_name = 'B'
) 
AND customer_id NOT IN
(SELECT customer_id 
 FROM Orders
 WHERE product_name = 'C'
) 
```

解法二：
```html
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name
FROM Customers c, Orders o
Where c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY o.customer_id
HAVING SUM(o.product_name = 'A')>0 AND SUM(o.product_name = 'B')>0
AND SUM(o.product_name = 'C')=0
```
