## 1. What is Database?
A database is an organized collection of data, stored and retrieved digitally from a remote or local computer system. Databases can be vast and complex, and such databases are developed using fixed design and modeling approaches.

## 2.What is DBMS?
DBMS stands for Database Management System. DBMS is a system software responsible for the creation, retrieval, updation and management of the database. It ensures that our data is consistent, organized and is easily accessible by serving as an interface between the database and its end users or application softwares.

## 3.What is RDBMS? How is it different from DBMS?
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. The key difference here, compared to DBMS, is that RDBMS stores data in the form of a collection of tables and relations can be defined between the common fields of these tables. Most modern database management systems like MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2 and Amazon Redshift are based on RDBMS.

## 4.What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. It is especially useful in handling organized data comprised of entities (variables) and relations between different entities of the data.

## 5.What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?
SQL is a standard language for retrieving and manipulating structured databases. On the contrary, MySQL is a relational database management system, like SQL Server, Oracle or IBM DB2, that is used to manage SQL database

## 6. What are Tables and Fields?
A table is an organized collection of data stored in the form of rows and columns. Columns can be categorized as vertical and rows as horizontal. The columns in a table are called fields while the rows can be referred to as records.

## 7.What are Constraints in SQL?
Constraints are used to specify the rules concerning data in the table. It can be applied for single or multiple fields in an SQL table during creation of table or after creationg using the ALTER TABLE command. The constraints are:

* NOT NULL - Restricts NULL value from being inserted into a column.
* CHECK - Verifies that all values in a field satisfy a condition.
* DEFAULT - Automatically assigns a default value if no value has been specified for the field.
* UNIQUE - Ensures unique values to be inserted into the field.
* INDEX - Indexes a field providing faster retrieval of records.
* PRIMARY KEY - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
* FOREIGN KEY - Ensures referential integrity for a record in another table.

## 8.What is a Primary Key?
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain UNIQUE values and has an implicit NOT NULL constraint.A table in SQL is strictly restricted to have one and only one primary key, which is comprised of single or multiple fields (columns).

```html
CREATE TABLE Students ( 	 /* Create table with a single field as primary key */
    ID INT NOT NULL
    Name VARCHAR(255)
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

CREATE TABLE Students ( 	 /* Create table with multiple fields as primary key */
    ID INT NOT NULL
    LastName VARCHAR(255)
    FirstName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT PK_Student
    PRIMARY KEY (ID, FirstName)
);

ALTER TABLE Students 	 /* Set a column as primary key */
ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID);

ALTER TABLE Students 	 /* Set multiple columns as primary key */
ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Student 	 /*Naming a Primary Key*/
PRIMARY KEY (ID, FirstName);

```

## 9.What is a UNIQUE constraint?
A UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different. This provides uniqueness for the column(s) and helps identify each row uniquely. Unlike primary key, there can be multiple unique constraints defined per table.

```html
CREATE TABLE Students ( 	 /* Create table with a single field as unique */
    ID INT NOT NULL UNIQUE
    Name VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Students ( 	 /* Create table with multiple fields as unique */
    ID INT NOT NULL
    LastName VARCHAR(255)
    FirstName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    CONSTRAINT PK_Student
    UNIQUE (ID, FirstName)
);

ALTER TABLE Students 	 /* Set a column as unique */
ADD UNIQUE (ID);

ALTER TABLE Students 	 /* Set multiple columns as unique */
ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Student 	 /* Naming a unique constraint */
UNIQUE (ID, FirstName);
```

## 10.What is a Foreign Key?
A FOREIGN KEY comprises of single or collection of fields in a table that essentially refer to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. Foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity in the relation between two tables.

The table with the foreign key constraint is labelled as the child table, and the table containing the candidate key is labelled as the referenced or parent table.

```html
CREATE TABLE Students ( 	 /* Create table with foreign key - Way 1 */
    ID INT NOT NULL
    Name VARCHAR(255)
    LibraryID INT
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
    FOREIGN KEY (Library_ID) REFERENCES Library(LibraryID)
);

CREATE TABLE Students ( 	 /* Create table with foreign key - Way 2 */
    ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
    Name VARCHAR(255)
    LibraryID INT FOREIGN KEY (Library_ID) REFERENCES Library(LibraryID)
);


ALTER TABLE Students 	 /* Add a new foreign key */
ADD FOREIGN KEY (LibraryID)
REFERENCES Library (LibraryID);
```

A FOREIGN KEY comprises of single or collection of fields in a table that essentially refer to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. Foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity in the relation between two tables.

## 11. What is a Join? List its different types.
The SQL Join clause is used to combine records (rows) from two or more tables in a SQL database based on a related column between the two.

#### There are four different types of JOINs in SQL:

* (INNER) JOIN: Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables involved in the join. This is the widely used join for queries.
N Table_B;

* LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records/rows from the left and the matched records/rows from the right table

* RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records/rows from the right and the matched records/rows from the left table.

* FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Retrieves all the records where there is a match in either the left or right table.

## 12.What is a Self-Join?
A self JOIN is a case of regular join where a table is joined to itself based on some relation between its own column(s). Self-join uses the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN clause and a table alias is used to assign different names to the table within the query.

## 13.What is a Cross-Join?
Cross join can be defined as a cartesian product of the two tables included in the join. The table after join contains the same number of rows as in the cross-product of number of rows in the two tables. If a WHERE clause is used in cross join then the query will work like an INNER JOIN.

## 14.What is an Index? Explain its different types.
A database index is a data structure that provides quick lookup of data in a column or columns of a table. It enhances the speed of operations accessing data from a database table at the cost of additional writes and memory to maintain the index data structure.

数据库索引是一种数据结构，可以快速查找表的一个或多个列中的数据。 它以额外的写入和内存维护索引数据结构为代价，提高了从数据库表访问数据的操作速度。

```html
example:
CREATE INDEX index_name 	 /* Create Index */
ON table_name (column_1, column_2);

DROP INDEX index_name; 	 /* Drop Index */
```
There are different types of indexes that can be created for different purposes:
#### Unique and Non-Unique Index:

Unique indexes are indexes that help maintain data integrity by ensuring that no two rows of data in a table have identical key values. Once a unique index has been defined for a table, uniqueness is enforced whenever keys are added or changed within the index.

```html
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX myIndex
ON students (enroll_no);
```
Non-unique indexes, on the other hand, are not used to enforce constraints on the tables with which they are associated. Instead, non-unique indexes are used solely to improve query performance by maintaining a sorted order of data values that are used frequently.

#### Clustered and Non-Clustered Index:
Clustered indexes are indexes whose order of the rows in the database correspond to the order of the rows in the index. This is why only one clustered index can exist in a given table, whereas, multiple non-clustered indexes can exist in the table.

The only difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes is that the database manager attempts to keep the data in the database in the same order as the corresponding keys appear in the clustered index.

Clustering index can improve the performance of most query operations because they provide a linear-access path to data stored in the database.

## 16. What is Data Integrity?
Data Integrity is the assurance of accuracy and consistency of data over its entire life-cycle, and is a critical aspect to the design, implementation and usage of any database. It also defines integrity constraints to enforce business rules on the data when it is entered into an application or a database.

## 17. What is a Query?
A query is a request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables. A database query can be either a select query or an action query.
```html
SELECT fname, lname 		 /* select query */
FROM myDb.students
WHERE student_id = 1;
UPDATE myDB.students 		 /* action query */
SET fname = 'Captain', lname = 'America'
WHERE student_id = 1;
```

## 18. What is a Subquery? What are its types?
A subquery is a query within another query, also known as nested query or inner query . It is used to restrict or enhance the data to be queried by the main query.

For example, here we fetch the contact information for students who have enrolled for the maths subject:
```html
SELECT name, email, mob, address
FROM myDb.contacts
WHERE roll_no IN (
	 SELECT roll_no
	 FROM myDb.students
	 WHERE subject = 'Maths');
```
##### There are two types of subquery - Correlated and Non-Correlated：

* A correlated subquery cannot be considered as an independent query, but it can refer the column in a table listed in the FROM of the main query.

* A non-correlated subquery can be considered as an independent query and the output of subquery is substituted in the main query.
